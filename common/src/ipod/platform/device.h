// What the host machine can say about itself that the iPod's firmware said about the device:
// the wall clock and the battery.
//
// **Why this is shared.** Every title asks for both through `miscTBD` — #12 for the clock, #13
// for the charge — and every title had its own copy of the answer, which is how five copies came
// to disagree. The Cubis 2 recomp found the clock wrong in all of them (2026-08-28): the hour was
// handed over already converted to 12-hour, and the games do that conversion themselves from a
// 24-hour value, so every title drew its status bar with the afternoon folded onto the morning.
// The battery was `return 100;` in all five. Neither is a fact about a *binary*, which is the
// test for what belongs here (../../../README.md): they are facts about the machine the port is
// running on, and there is one right answer per platform.
//
// **Why it is platform-specific.** There is no portable way to ask for a battery, and the three
// platforms that matter each have one. `device.cpp` has an implementation per platform and a
// fallback that says "full" for a machine with no battery to report — a desktop, or a platform
// nobody has written the call for yet.
//
// **And why there is a seam.** Some platforms will not answer this library directly. Android is
// the case: an app there is refused `/sys/class/power_supply`, and the charge is the system's to
// hand over rather than a file to read. Asking for it needs SDL, which this library deliberately
// does not link (../../../common/CMakeLists.txt), so the platform layer installs a reader
// instead — `set_battery_reader` below.
