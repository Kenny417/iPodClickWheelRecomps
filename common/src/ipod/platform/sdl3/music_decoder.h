// Turning the game's music into PCM an audio device can take.
//
// The six tracks are AAC in an MP4 container (`m0.m4a` … `a2.m4a`, 44.1 kHz stereo, 45 to 115
// seconds each). SDL decodes WAV and nothing else, so the sound effects can be handed straight
// to it and the music cannot. Until now the music was played by spawning `afplay`, which worked
// and nothing more: a child process has no volume this program can set, no way to be mixed with
// the sound effects, and exists only on macOS.
//
// This is the seam that replaces it. A decoder answers PCM in chunks and the caller feeds an
// SDL audio stream with it, exactly as a sound effect's samples are fed — so the music is on
// the same device, at the same volume, stopped by the same call.
//
// A track is decoded as it plays rather than in one go: the longest is 115 seconds, which is
// about 20 MB decoded, and reading it up front would cost that much memory and a visible pause
// at the start of every course.
//
// macOS decodes through AudioToolbox's ExtAudioFile and Windows through a Media Foundation
// source reader — each a system framework rather than a new dependency (a Windows "N" edition
// without the Media Feature Pack has no decoder, and reports that once). Everywhere else there
// is no decoder yet and `music_decoding_supported()` answers false; the caller says so once and
// the game plays on in silence. Adding a platform means implementing this interface for it —
// MediaCodec on Android, a bundled decoder elsewhere — and nothing above this file changes.
