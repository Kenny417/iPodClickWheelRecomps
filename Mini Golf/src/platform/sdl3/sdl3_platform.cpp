// The desktop platform on SDL3: a scaled window for the 320×240 screen, the keyboard and a
// gamepad as the click wheel, and SDL audio streams for the sound effects and the music alike.
//
// The keyboard and a gamepad are the ways in (src/platform/sdl3/sdl3_gamepad.h). A mouse wheel
// and a trackpad were once read as the click wheel as well, and are not any more: what a trackpad
// sends cannot be told apart from what a swipe up the pad sends by accident (a quarter of the
// travel of an upward swipe arrives on the sideways axis, and its tail arrives on that axis alone),
// so a gesture nobody bound kept turning the menu. Every control is now one a player can see and
// change in Settings ▸ Input.
//
// The defaults, all rebindable:
//   ← / →                  turn the click wheel (one row a press; held, it keeps turning)
//   Space                  Select (centre button)
//   ↑                      Menu    [  Previous    ↓  Play/Pause    ]  Next
//   P                      screenshot  Q  quit   ⌘, (Ctrl+, off a Mac)  settings
//   - / =                  step the window through whole multiples; F or F11 full screen
// and on a gamepad, all rebindable too:
//   left stick             turns the wheel, by as much as it is pushed
//   D-pad ← / →            turn it a row at a time    A  Select    B  Menu
//   Start                  Play/Pause                 L / R  Rewind / Fast forward
//
// Sound effects and music both play through SDL audio streams, so both answer to the game's own
// Volume page (`set_audio_level`). The music is AAC, which SDL does not decode; that is
// `music_decoder.h`'s job, and it is the only part of the audio that is per-platform.
