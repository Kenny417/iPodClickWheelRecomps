# Mini Golf

Mini Golf is the furthest along of the six games here, and the only one that's finished. The whole thing has been recompiled and then decompiled by hand, so there's no machine-translated code left in it at all: every function the iPod ran is now readable C++ with a real name on it. It's also the only one that runs on three platforms instead of two: macOS, Windows, and the Nintendo Switch.

It's the click wheel Mini Golf from 2008: 54 holes across three courses, played by spinning the wheel to line up a shot and clicking to swing. On a modern machine you do the spinning with the arrow keys, a gamepad stick, or a D-pad. It's not quite the same as a real wheel under your thumb, but it plays well once you're used to it. 

## The game's files

Like every game here, you bring your own copy of the files. Mini Golf's folder is `88888`. The first time you open the game it asks you for a zip of that folder, checks every file in it against the size and checksum it shipped with, and keeps it beside your saves from then on. If the zip is wrong or damaged it tells you why and asks again. Nothing in this repo contains those files, and I won't help you find or decrypt them.

## Cheats

There's a Cheats screen under Options now, with five toggles:

- **Unlock courses** makes all three courses selectable no matter how few you've earned
- **No stroke limit** raises the ten-stroke cap to 99
- **No out of bounds** puts a ball that leaves the green back where you played it from. The stroke still counts.
- **Aim guide** has the aim line follow the power meter as it swings, instead of only showing the full reach
- **Ghost trail** faintly draws the path the ball took on your best round of a hole while you line up the next one

A round you play with a rule-changing cheat doesn't count: no best score, no stats, no course unlocked by it. The round still plays out to the end, it just leaves no trace. Ghost trail is the exception, since it only shows you a hole you've already finished, so a round with it on still counts. Ghost trail is in alpha so it might be a little wonky.

## Settings

Open the settings window with ⌘+, on macOS or Ctrl+, on Windows. It has three tabs:

- **General** is the frame rate: 30, 60, or unlocked. It's 30 by default, which is how the iPod ran it.
- **Input** lists every action with the key it's bound to, and you rebind by picking a new key from the list. There's a Restore Defaults button. A gamepad works too, out of the box: the D-pad or left stick turns the wheel, A selects, B is Menu, and so on, all of it rebindable.
- **Graphics** is how the small picture gets blown up to fill your window. Sharp (the default) keeps the pixels square and stops the edges crawling when you resize, Nearest is hard blocks, and Smooth is soft. There's also a render scale up to 8x, which won't magically sharpen 2008 art but does clean up edges and make the text a lot easier to read.

Everything you change is saved and comes back next time you launch. Fullscreen is F or F11.

The one thing I took out is Brightness. It set the iPod's backlight, and nothing this runs on has one to set, so that row has been removed.

## Building

You need CMake 3.21 or newer, a C++17 compiler, Python 3.10+, SDL3, and zlib. And your own copy of the game's folder, same as running it.

### macOS

This is the one I actually develop and play on, so it's the most tested by a wide margin.

```sh
cmake -B build && cmake --build build
open build/minigolf.app
```

You get a real `.app` that carries its own SDL inside it, so you can move it wherever you like and double-click it. 

Note that this game hasn't been signed so macOS might not let you open it. If that's the case, then go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Click Allow on the section that mentions Mini Golf.

### Linux

Nothing special: SDL3 and zlib from your distribution, and the ordinary build.

```sh
cmake -B build && cmake --build build
./build/minigolf
```

On Fedora that's `sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ SDL3-devel zlib-ng-compat-devel`; on Debian and
Ubuntu, `sudo apt install cmake g++ libsdl3-dev zlib1g-dev`. If your distribution is old enough
that it has no SDL3, build SDL from source and point CMake at it with `-DSDL3_DIR=`.

The game's files go where the first run puts them, `~/.local/share/ipod-mini-golf/88888`, or
wherever `$XDG_DATA_HOME` says. There's no settings window on Linux — that's a Cocoa window on
macOS and a Win32 one on Windows, and nobody has written the third — so the frame rate, the
scaling and the key bindings are whatever the saved settings say, and the in-game Options and
Cheats screens still work. There's no background music either: the `.m4a` tracks need a decoder, and unlike macOS, Windows and Android there's no obvious system one to borrow here. The sound effects all work.

### Windows

There's a 64-bit Windows build, and it's the same program as the Mac one. The easy way to make it is the cross-build script, which does the whole thing inside a container, so all you actually need is Docker:

```sh
tools/windows-build.sh
```

That leaves `minigolf.exe` and the `SDL3.dll` it loads in `build-windows/dist/`. On a real Windows machine with MSVC you can also just `cmake -B build` the normal way. Either way, I haven't put many hours into Windows yet, so treat it as working but lightly tested. 

One thing to note is that Windows supports .m4a background music through its Media Foundation library, as macOS does through AudioToolbox and Android through MediaCodec. Linux and the Switch have no decoder here yet, so they play the sound effects and no music.

### Nintendo Switch

There's a homebrew build too, a `.nro` the Homebrew Menu can load. Like the Windows build it's done in a container, so Docker is all you need:

```sh
tools/switch-build.sh
```

That gives you `build-switch/minigolf-switch.nro`. Copy it to `sdmc:/switch/minigolf-switch.nro`, and copy your `88888` folder to `sdmc:/switch/minigolf/88888/`, since the Switch build has no file browser to ask for it. Then launch it from the Homebrew Menu.

Big caveat here: I haven't booted my Switch in years so this has never actually run on real hardware. It cross-compiles cleanly and the parts that are plain logic are shared with the desktop build, but the rest is code review and hope. I ran it in an emulator and it seemed to work well. If you try it and it works, I'd genuinely love to hear about it. There's no music on the Switch yet either, and names are still spelled out on the wheel since there's no keyboard for it.

### Android

There's an Android build too, for a handheld with a physical gamepad — a Retroid, an Odin, a
Steam-Deck-shaped thing running Android. `tools/android-build.sh` produces and installs an APK.
Unlike the Windows and Switch builds it is not containerised, because every piece of it is a
download that needs no root and no package manager. See `android/README.md` for the whole of it,
start to finish; the short version is:

```sh
tools/android-build.sh install
```

with three things in place beforehand (the script says which one is missing, if one is):

    ~/Android/android-ndk-r28c   the NDK
    ~/Android/Sdk                the platform and build-tools for API 35
    ~/Android/sdl3/prefix        SDL3's Android release, unpacked

Copy your `88888` folder to `/sdcard/Android/data/org.ipodrecomp.minigolf/files/88888` and start
it; if it isn't there the app says so on screen, with the path, the way the Switch build does.

The D-pad turns the wheel, A selects, B is Menu. There's no settings window, the same as Linux,
and names are spelled out on the wheel rather than with the on-screen keyboard, the same as the
Switch. The background music does play: Android's own MediaCodec decodes the `.m4a` tracks. The launcher icon is the game's own artwork and so is not in this
repository: `tools/android-icon.py` makes it from a copy you supply, and without it the app
simply gets the system's default icon.

This has run on a Retroid Pocket Nova (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, Android 13). It's arm64 only, which
is every Android handheld worth playing this on.

## Legal

The game belongs to its publisher. None of its code, art, music, or levels are in this repository, and no build contains any of it. What's here is a port: my own host code and a hand decompilation of the game logic, which needs your own copy of the files to do anything at all.

## Licence

GPL-3.0-or-later, like the rest of the ports; the tools under `../common/tools/` are MIT. See `../LICENSING.md` for the split and what it does and doesn't cover.
