# What comes out is build-android/minigolf.apk, for arm64-v8a — every Android handheld worth
# playing this on is arm64, and a second ABI doubles the download to serve machines that are not
# out there.
#
# **There is no Java, and no Gradle.** SDL ships org.libsdl.app.SDLActivity already compiled in
# its .aar, and that activity loads "SDL3" and then "main" and calls SDL_main in the second — so
# the port is built as `libmain.so` (CMakeLists.txt renames it) and the app needs no class of its
# own. What is left is the four steps below, which are what Gradle would have run anyway: dex
# SDL's classes, link a manifest, add the libraries, sign. Adding Gradle would mean a JDK, an
# Android Gradle Plugin, and a wrapper, to save four lines.
#
# Unlike the Windows and Switch builds this is not containerised, because the pieces are all
# no-root downloads that live under ~/Android:
#
#   ANDROID_NDK   the NDK              (r28c or newer; SDL asks for r28c)
#   ANDROID_SDK   platform + build-tools (API 35)
#   SDL3_ANDROID  SDL's .aar, unpacked — the .aar is also a Python script that does it:
#                     python3 SDL3-<version>.aar -o <prefix>
