# Regression test: the pause menu opens and the game keeps running.
#
#   tests/pause-menu.sh [path/to/minigolf-headless]
#
# Pressing Menu several minutes into a round used to freeze the game outright. The game works out
# how long a button has been held from when it saw it go down, which it learns from the firmware's
# list of button events; the host had no such list, so every press read as a hold minutes long and
# the game asked to be suspended (game/app.cpp `handle_long_presses`). The screen then stopped.
#
# The oracle cannot catch this: its recordings were made with the emulator, which takes the same
# shortcut, so they contain the freeze too and diff.sh runs with --emulator-firmware to reproduce it.
# This test therefore checks the thing itself — that the picture is still changing after the pause
# menu opens — rather than comparing against a recording.
#
# Exit 2 means "cannot run", which CTest treats as a skip: the game image is the player's own copy.
