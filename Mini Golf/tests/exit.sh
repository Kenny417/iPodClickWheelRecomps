#
# The row asks the firmware to suspend the eApp — on an iPod that hands control back to the iPod's
# own menu. This firmware has nothing to hand back to, so the program ends. It used to run on with
# the game suspended, which looked like a freeze.
#
# The check is that the run stops before the script does: the script takes a screenshot after the
# row is chosen, and that screenshot must never be reached.
#
# Exit 2 means "cannot run", which CTest treats as a skip: the game image is the player's own copy.
