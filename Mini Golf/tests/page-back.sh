#
# Leaving a page means calling the screen's `next_enter`, which `page_enter` works out and used to
# store before installing the screen — and installing a screen writes all four of its fields, so
# the stored value was overwritten with nothing. Select and Menu then did nothing at all and the
# page could not be left: the game looked frozen.
#
# The oracle did not catch it: no recorded case opens a page and leaves it again. This checks the
# thing itself — that the picture changes after Menu is pressed on a page.
#
# Exit 2 means "cannot run", which CTest treats as a skip: the game image is the player's own copy.
