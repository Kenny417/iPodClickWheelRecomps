# Regression test: "Return to Menu" opens the save-game card instead of killing the game.
#
#   tests/return-to-menu.sh [path/to/minigolf-headless]
#
# That row opens the card that asks whether to save first, and the card's renderer (0x18014300)
# was a stub that fired the assert trap: no recorded session ever reached it, so it had never been
# decompiled, and choosing the row ended the process. It is decompiled now, and this is the check
# that it stays reached and stays drawn.
#
# The oracle cannot see this either: none of its recordings open the card. What is checked here is
# that the run survives to the end and that the card is a different picture from the pause menu it
# was chosen from.
#
# Exit 2 means "cannot run", which CTest treats as a skip: the game image is the player's own copy.
