# Regression test: the Cheats screen this port adds can be reached, used, and left again, and
# what it was told is on file afterwards.
#
#   tests/cheats.sh [path/to/minigolf-headless]
#
# The oracle cannot check any of this — it compares against logs recorded from the emulator,
# which had no Cheats row at all, and `--emulator-firmware` takes the row away again so those
# recordings still line up (src/game/cheats.h). So the feature needs a test of its own, and this
# is it: the screen is opened, two cheats are turned on, and Menu goes back to Options.
#
# Three things are checked, each of which has broken at some point while this was written:
# that the screen is reached (the picture changes when Select is pressed on the Cheats row),
# that toggling redraws the row it toggled (the label carries its own ON/OFF), and that the
# flags reached cheats.txt in the platform's save store.
#
# The pictures are compared for *difference* only. Two frames of the same screen never hash the
# same anyway — the ball beside the cursor spins and the selected row's letters ripple — so
# "came back to the same screen" is not a thing a hash can say.
#
# Exit 2 means "cannot run", which CTest treats as a skip: the game image is the player's own copy.
