#
# The other oracle (tests/diff.sh) compares against a log recorded from the emulator, which is why
# new cases could not be added: the emulator no longer reproduces the recordings it made. This
# needs no recording. The pure recompilation in build-recomp/ *is* the original code — every ARM
# instruction translated, nothing hand-written — so running both builds on the same script and
# comparing what they ask the frameworks for tests exactly what the recordings test: whether the
# decompilation still means the same thing.
#
# It is the weaker of the two only in that both sides are built here, from one image; where the
# recordings exist they are the better witness, and both are run.
#
# Exit 2 means "cannot run this case", which CTest treats as a skip: the pure recompilation is
# built by tests/check-recomp.sh, and the game image is the player's own copy.
