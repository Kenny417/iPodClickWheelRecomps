# Oracle test: run the headless recomp on a scripted session and diff its framework-call log
# against the emulator's recording of the same script.
#
#   tests/diff.sh <case> [path/to/minigolf-headless] [--lines=N] [--exact]
#
# <case> names tests/scripts/<case>.script and tests/expected/<case>.calls. The expected log was
# recorded with the emulator's `play --call-log` (see PLAN.md "Verification oracle" for the
# flags). Exit status is 0 when the logs are identical; otherwise the first differing call is
# printed with both sides, which is where the recomp's behaviour departs from the emulator's.
#
# --lines=N compares only the first N lines, for checking progress before a case fully passes.
# --exact compares every logged register and stack word (see tests/diff.py for the two modes).
